# HTTP Phone Composer for Android

This is an Android Studio project that brings an HTTP API to your phone.

Important: the spacing choice is trash, I will cleanup the code and reset the repository one day!

If you need to initiate a call from an application of yours, this project is really nice.

Be aware that passwords and phone numbers are sent unencrypted over the network between the initiator application and the phone.

There are plenty of settings.

I hope that most of the required files are included.
